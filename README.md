It will be quite some time before I get around to this project.
I haven't done any computer programming in a number of years, but when I did, I did it for a very long time every day.
I had to quit computer programming cold turkey because it was interfering with my life.
But with that said, I never developed for Android or used Kotlin. So I have to learn that first.
Being that I have experience with other languages, I figure I could dive head first, start with this forked project, and just use it as a base to come out with my original idea from years ago.

short summary...
