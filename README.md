It will be quite some time before I get around to this project.
I haven't done any computer programming in a number of years, but when I did, I did it for a very long time every day.
I had to quit computer programming cold turkey because it was interfering with my life.
But with that said, I never developed for Android or used Kotlin. So I have to learn that first.
Being that I have experience with other languages, I figure I could dive head first, start with this forked project, and just modify a few things to come out with my original idea from years ago.

Have you ever analyzed the psychology of your own self when you're typing with your thumbs?
Have you ever noticed how you will use your left thumb for both sides of the keyboard and your right thumb for both sides of the keyboard Back and forth?
Example, your left thumb will press somewhere on the left side of the keyboard, Then for the next consecutive key, your left thumb will press somewhere on the right side of the keyboard. And then for the next consecutive key, your right thumb will press somewhere on the left side of the keyboard, for example, Just visualize that for a moment. You realize we do this all the time, correct? Do you know the reason? Have you ever thought about it or questioned it?

The reason is, If you could speak an entire book in one second, why wouldn't you? We want to communicate as fast as possible, aka type as fast as possible.
Obviously, your own brain knows the physical layout of your own body.
Your subconscious is realizing the flow and rhythm of your typing and that physically doing that is faster.
So here is a solution.


My design idea is there are two boxes, a little ways spaced apart, and each box has a three by three grid inside.
The main absolute primary objective of this keyboard is to make it so that you never consecutively press your left thumb twice or your right thumb twice.
You will ALWAYS 100% of the time always alternate using your left thumb and right thumb for every individual key press.

I only know English, so I will only be able to do this for English.
But I'm going to have to build a database to start with.
Running a few algorithms on every individual word in the English language individually
and then process every sentence and paragraph of the dictionary and encyclopedia and scour the internet for countless articles
What words tend to follow words?
What words tend to follow previous words with certain groupings?
What are all of the words that would ever start an individual sentence or a paragraph?
What are all of the words that would begin the response of a question?
Just really, really digging into the English language.
I probably didn't word that the best way, but basically getting extremely predictive.

If I get the algorithm perfect, without any personal individual predictiveness.
Just only predictiveness based on the English language.
Then you could take two completely different people running my keyboard who have enough experience on it to quote unquote have mastered it so they're never stumbling while typing everything just flows smoothly.
And then they could trade phones/tablets.
and keep on typing away without noticing a single thing different. No stumbling.

As of now, I would like to point out the hundredth monkey experiment. 

With that said, if I include a feature where the keyboard learns from the individual user to get even more predictive, then you would not benefit from the effect of the hundredth monkey experiment.

So not having that feature, meaning the keyboard cannot learn from the individual user. If you are the very first person to run my keyboard, it will take you however long it takes to learn it, very likely quite some time.. But if you are the hundredth or thousandth person to run my keyboard, believe it or not, you will learn it quicker.

So, with that stated, I question, should I add the feature to learn from the individual user in such a way that does not hurt privacy?

The reason I go in depth to say all that, from someone looking over your shoulder, not knowing what is going on, this keyboard is going to look extremely wild to them.

Your brain will catch on because the wildness will be static, always the same for each individual unique instance.

So if I incorporated the feature to adapt the keyboard to each individual person let's just say you take a month and you master it and someone else is running the keyboard on their phone and you go to type on their phone it is seriously going to hinder slow you down very likely.

So I likely won't include that feature, but what is everyone's opinion on that?

But based off of the predictiveness
For whatever thumb you are currently under for the next consecutive character,
The letter with the highest percentage of predictability will be in the center of the grid where the thumb will mostly be.
and the letter with the least percentage of predictability of the top nine, will be in the bottom corner where the thumb curls in more tightly. AKA more stressful on the thumb being not extended.
With that stated, you can guess how the rest of the characters will be laid out.
It's all about comfort.

Something to take note of. With the predictability in junction with dictionaries, there will be many, many opportunities of typing where your left and right thumbs are just back and forth over the dead center of each grid, many consecutive times to finish out a word.

A side benefit to this keyboard is it potentially could help you learn to spell words you're not that good at.

One feature I thought about so you don't have to move your thumbs out of the way of the grid and then back over to the grid as in hunting and packing is To mirror the grids so they are identical from left to right.
Maybe that would help on the 100% removal of your thumb outside of the grid while hunting and packing. What are y'all's opinions on that feature? AND If the next nine predicted characters are not what you want for the thumb's turn that you're under, then do an additional tap and hold of the thumb you just used. And it will not matter where the consecutive use of the same thumb lands, that press will not take. What will happen is the Grid for the following thumb that should have been used will change to the next highest nine predicted characters.
AND If those nine characters are not what you want, While the thumb with the consecutive use is still pressing on the screen, give it a little bit of a slide in any direction, and the grid under the thumb that should have been used will populate with the last 8 of 26 alphabet characters.

So worst case scenario is you're alternating back and forth fluently and then you run into a situation of the appropriate thumb ((with the design of this keyboard)) does not have the character that you want.
Then you would do a consecutive press and hold anywhere inside of the grid of the previous thumb (making an undesirable consecutive use). The appropriate grid will populate with the next nine, and if that is not what you want, while the other thumb is still holding, give a little bit of a slide (in any direction?).
9 plus 9 plus 8 is 26, so that covers everything in regards to the alphabet.

There could also be a feature while you are typing flawlessly. Instead of an individual tap, it would be an individual tap with a sliding motion in any of the four and or eight directions for period, comma, enter/new line, capitalization, etc.. 

And another feature could be having both of your thumbs touch the screen at the same time, far apart or close together, and swipe up at the same time, could load an original keyboard, Dvorak included lol

There are all kinds of little features I've thought of. I just got to take the time to remember them all.

If you wouldn't mind being a one-on-one tutor teaching me the environment for writing APK applications for Android along with the Kotlin or whatever alternative can be used for Android.
Basically kick-starting me off with enough knowledge just for a keyboard, nothing much else. That way I can finish off this project before fully knowing the entire language.
Or If you have any feature ideas to add to the keyboard
Then give me an email.

This is an email I don't use for much of anything, so it might be a bit before I get to you.
I am not too familiar with GitHub, but if you have a way to message me on GitHub and GitHub notifies me, then we can chat on GitHub.
